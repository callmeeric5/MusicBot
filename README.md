## Background



It is a product-type project for the deep learning class.

Music is a common way for most people to release stress, seek comfort, and pass the time. However, major music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music lack mood-based recommendation features. Additionally, they do not seem to effectively integrate AI technology into their products, which can come across as insensitive to users' needs.

## Object

To fill the blank in the market, this project aims to develop a chatbot, leveraging AI to recommend the most suitable playlists based on user input. Users can write down a few sentences about their feelings or fulfill the questionsheet provided then receive their recommendations of music that is close to the mood.
